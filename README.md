# ecommerce_backend

## Description

The goal for this project was to build an ecommerce backend that can be updated by the user using different
routes and methods. The database was created and seeded in mysql, and the api routes were written using express middleware and models sequelized a node package. 

## Installation

To start the application you have to first create the db, next seed the data, and after that you can run "node server.js" in the terminal to start hosting the server on your local machine.
